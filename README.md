# RPG Extensions for DocBook 5.0

These are schema extensions for [DocBook 5.0][1] that provider a grammar for
marking up concepts present in various table-top role-playing games (TTRPGs).

These extensions attempt to describe concepts that are both general across many
TTRPGs as well as ones specific to certain rules systems.

At this moment, these extensions include some level of support for the following
specific systems:

* [Pathfinder][2]

## Namespaces and Versioning

As described in <http://docbook.org/tdg5/en/html/ch05.html#s-notdocbook>,
the extensions all currently fall under the `http://docbook.org/ns/docbook`
namespace. It is, however, likely that we will be expanding to put some or all
of the extension elements into their own namespace due to similar-but-different
elements from various TTRPG systems.

The `version` associated with this extension is 
`5.0-extension rwdalpe_rpg-{version#}`.
